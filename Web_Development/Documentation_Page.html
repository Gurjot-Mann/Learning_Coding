        <p>Cascading Stylesheets or CSS is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While HTML is used
          to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. For example,
          you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns,
          or add animations and other decorative features.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML
              module from mdn</a> first.</li>
          <li>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the same
            time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting and much
            more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't learn CSS without knowing HTML.</li>
          <li>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web passively
            (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up.</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Syntax">
      <header>CSS Syntax</header>
      <article>
        <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to
          particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
        <p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The
          following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
        <code>h1 {</br>
    color: red;</br>
    font-size: 5em;</br>
}</code>
        <ul>

          <li>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going
            to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings (h1).</li>

          <li>We then have a set of curly braces <code>{ }</code>.</li>

          <li>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. We
            specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property
            after the colon (red in this example).</li>

          <li>This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair specifies a
            property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the
            property.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our
          example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property.
          This property can take various size units as a value.</p>

        <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
        <code>h1 {</br>
    color: red;</br>
    font-size: 5em;</br>
}</br>
</br>
p {</br>
    color: black;</br>
}

      <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
      <article>
        <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to
          use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across,
          however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of
          your document.</p>
        <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows
          that this is a CSS file.</p>
        <p>To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the <code>"head"</code> of the HTML
          document:</p>
        <code>
            <span><</span>link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
          </code>
        <p>
          This
          <link> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that
          stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css.
          Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS file:
        </p>
        <code>
              h1 {</br>
  color: red;</br>
}</br>
            </code>
        <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the
          document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an
          HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.</p>
        <p>You can continue to work in <code>styles.css</code> locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to
          continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the
          HTML document, just as we have with our document above.</p>

      <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
      <article>
        <p>By making our heading red, we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do
          this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To
          target all paragraphs in the document, you would use the selector <code>p</code>. To turn all paragraphs
          green, you would use:</p>
        <code>p {</br>
  color: green;</br>
}</code>
        <p>You can target multiple selectors at the same time by separating the selectors with a comma. If you want all
          paragraphs and all list items to be green, your rule would look like this:</p>
        <code>p, li {</br>
    color: green;</br>
}</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Changing_The_default_behaviour_of_elements">
      <header>Changing The default behaviour of elements</header>
      <article>
        <p>When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how the
          browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and our list
          has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they
          apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to
          style everything from scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same
          way.</p>
        <p>However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done by
          choosing the HTML element that you want to change and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks. A good
          example is
        <ul>, an unordered list. It has list bullets. If you don't want those bullets, you can remove them like so:</p>
          <code>li {</br>
  list-style-type: none;</br>
}</br>
</code>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_Class">
      <header>Adding a Class</header>
      <article>
        <p>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:</p>
        <code>
            <span><</span>ul></br>
  <span><</span>li>Item one<span><</span>/li></br>
  <span><</span>li class="special">Item two<span><</span>/li></br>
  <span><</span>li>Item <span><</span>em>three<span><</span>/em><span><</span>/li></br>
<span><</span>/ul></br>
</code>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>In your CSS, you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop
              character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>
            <code>.special {</br>
  color: orange;</br>
  font-weight: bold;</br>
}
</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the class:
            </p>
            <code>li.special {</br>
  color: orange;</br>
  font-weight: bold;</br>
}</br>
</code>
</li>
<li>
  <p>This syntax means "target any li element that has a class of special". If you were to do this, then you would no longer be able to apply the class to a <code>(span)</code>
            or another element by adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:
            </p>
            <code>li.special,</br>
span.special {</br>
  color: orange;</br>
  font-weight: bold;</br>
}
</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

    <section class="main-section" id="Styling_based_on_location">
      <header>Styling based on location</header>
      <article>
        <p>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document. There
          are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>This selector will select any <code>em</code> element that is inside (a descendant of) an
              <code>li</code>So in your example document, you should find that the <code>em</code> in the third list
              item is now purple, but the one inside the paragraph is unchanged.</p>
            <code>li em {</br>
  color: rebeccapurple;</br>
}
</code>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when it comes directly after a heading at the
              same hierarchy level in the HTML. To do so, place a <code>+</code> (an adjacent sibling combinator)
              between the selectors.</p>
            <code>h1 + p {</br>
  font-size: 200%;</br>
}</code>
          </li>

        </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Styling_based_on_state">
      <header>Styling based on state</header>
      <article>
        <p>The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial is the ability to style things based on
          their state.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>You can use CSS to target these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink and visited
              links green.</p>
            <code>a:link {</br>
  color: pink;</br>
}</br>
</br>
a:visited {</br>
  color: green;</br>
}</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it, for example by removing the
              underline, which is achieved by the next rule:</p>
            <code>a:hover {</br>
  text-decoration: none;</br>
}</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Combining_selectors_and_combinators">
      <header>Combining selectors and combinators</header>
      <article>
        <p>It is worth noting that you can combine multiple selectors and combinators together.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <code>/* selects any <code>span</code> that is inside a <code>p</code>, which is inside an
            <code>article</code> */</br>
            </br>
            article p span { }</br>
            </br>
            /* selects any <code>p</code> that comes directly after a <code>ul</code>, which comes directly after an
            <code>h1</code> */</br>
            </br>
            h1 + ul + p { }</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You can combine multiple types together, too. Try adding the following into your code:</p>
            <code>body h1 + p .special {</br>
  color: yellow;</br>
  background-color: black;</br>
  padding: 5px;</br>
}</code>
            <p>This will style any element with a class of special, which is inside a <code>p</code>, which comes just
              after an <code>h1</code>, which is inside a <code>body</code>. Phew!</p>
            <p>In the original HTML we provided, the only element styled is
              <code><span><</span>span class="special"></code>.</p>
            <p>Don't worry if this seems complicated at the moment — you'll soon start to get the hang of it as you
              write more CSS.</p>
